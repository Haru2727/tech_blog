## Description

    Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. It can help pass information and keep a developer on their toes.  Finding new ways to think about something is always useful to a coder.  Our task this week was to create a CMS-style blog site similar to Wordpress.  Where devs can publish their blog post and comment on other ones as well.
